# ⚛️ EventPulse — Local Events + AI Insights (Expo + Zustand + MMKV Edition)

## 🎯 Summary

EventPulse is a real-time local event discovery app that surfaces upcoming concerts, festivals, meetups, and shows based on the user’s live location.

It integrates real event APIs (Ticketmaster or Eventbrite), AI-generated summaries, and offline favorites — all wrapped in a smooth Expo + React Native experience.

##### Goal: When a user downloads the app, they instantly see real nearby events, view AI summaries, and experience my engineering quality firsthand — without logging in or setting up anything.

<!-- TODO MAKE THIS A CLEAR CACHE SCRIPT -->

[expo cli clear cache](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/clear-cache-windows/#expo-cli-and-npm)

- rm -rf node_modules
- npm cache clean --force
- npm install
- watchman watch-del-all
  <!-- - rm -fr $TMPDIR/haste-map-* -->
  <!-- - rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-cache -->

## Troubleshooting

1. ```
      A problem occurred evaluating settings 'android'.
      > A problem occurred starting process 'command 'node''
   ```

2. Installation error: INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES
   posiibly due to running builds (no eas) on simulator then on usb device. The type of usb cable was also an issue for others in link below
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2914105/what-is-install-parse-failed-no-certificates-error
   - rm -rf node_modules
   - rm package-lock.json
   - rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-map-\*
   - rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-cache
   - watchman watch-del-all
   - npm cache clean -f
   - Make sure Android studio is closed
   - uninstall any trace from phone
   - npm i
   - npx expo install --check
   - npx expo-doctor
   - npx expo run:android
3. Peer deps check
   - npm ls react react-test-renderer (had to downgrade this to react 19.1, it wanted react 19.2)


<!-- # Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
